# Purpose of this repo

Is to practice backend development coordinated with docker

# run the app

on the root directory run:

`docker-compose up --build`

# warnings

For development be careful using Windows.
I haven't tested it but it might fail because the file systems of the docker containers
and windows might bring issue.
Maybe not, but be careful.
